<h1>Syntax</h1>
<div class="center picturebox">
	<img src="Assets/img/selector.gif" style="height: 100px; width: 500px;">
</div>
<p>
	The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
	The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
	Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
	A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
    &lt;title>Demo&lt;/title>
    &lt;style type="text/css">
        p{
            color: blue;
            text-align: justify;
        }
    &lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;div>
        &lt;p>Hello World&lt;/p>
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
<p>
	In the internal style sheet, we are using <code>p</code> as the selector, it means we are selecting all the paragraph element in the document. We have defined two style here, one is color and another is text-align. The color of the all paragraph will be bule and the text will be justify aligned. There are various type of selector available in CSS to pick up the actual element to style. There are different rules we will discuss them in another chapter.
</p>
<p>
	So this is the basic syntax and this is all. Yes, This is everything. Now all you have to know the various kind of property and their possible values.
</p>








<h1>Comment</h1>
<p>
	CSS only supports only one type of comment. it starts with <code>/*</code> and ends with <code>*/</code>. It is a multiline comment.
</p>
<pre>
p {
    color: red;
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    text-align: center;
}
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
</pre>



<h1>Inclusion</h1>
<p>
    In HTML you can include CSS in three ways:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Inline Style</li>
        <li>Internal Stylesheet</li>
        <li>External Stylesheet</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>Inline Style</h2>
<p>Almost every elements in HTML support an attribute <code>style</code> which allows us to write CSS within this attribute. For Example -</p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="url" style="text-decoration:none;">Click Here&lt;/a>
</pre>
<p>
    You can write more than one CSS Rules inside this attribute -
</p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="url" style="text-decoration:none; color:blue; font-size:10px;">Click Here&lt;/a>
</pre>
<h2>Internal Stylesheet</h2>
<p>
    You can write all the CSS code inside the <code>style</code> element using CSS Query selector.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;head>
    &lt;style>
        body {
            background-color: linen;
        }
        
        h1 {
            color: maroon;
            margin-left: 40px;
        } 
    &lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
</pre>
<p>
    It doesn't matter where you write your internal style sheet. You can place <code>style</code> element anywhere in the document. But the best practice is inside the <code>head</code> element.
</p>
<h2>External Stylesheet</h2>
<p>
    You can use External stylesheet file and include them in your HTML file. Using <code>link</code> tag we can do this -
</p>
<pre>
&lt;head>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="url">
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;!-- body -->
&lt;/body>
</pre>
<p>
    You can use two kind of links here. One is CDN and another is local file. Local file is relative to the HTML document. For this concept refer to the HTML tutorial. You can use CDN that pulls in the file from the dedicated server. It's actually an URL where the file is located. There are some disadvantage and advantage of Using CDN.
</p>
<p>
    It is always better to use local version of file rather than using CDN. Because if you use CDN and the framework version is updated, the update will reflect in your file. This is good as long as you get what you are expecting. Otherwise you have to update your code with the framework version to adopt the changes.
