<h1>Where Clause</h1>
<p>The <code>WHERE</code> clause allows you to specify a search condition for the rows returned by a query. The following shows the syntax of the <code>WHERE</code> clause:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    search_condition;
</pre>
<p>The <code>search_condition</code> is a combination of one or more expressions using the logical operator <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> and <code>NOT</code>. The <code>SELECT</code> statement will include any row that satisfies the <code>search_condition</code> in the result. Besides the <code>SELECT</code> statement, you can use the <code>WHERE</code> clause in the <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code> statement to specify which rows to update or delete.</p>
<h3>Order of Execution</h3>
<p>When executing a <code>SELECT</code> statement with a <code>WHERE</code> clause, MySQL evaluates the <code>WHERE</code> clause after the <code>FROM</code> clause and before the <code>SELECT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> clauses:</p>

<h3>Example 1 : Equality Operator</h3>
<p>The following query uses the <code>WHERE</code> clause to find all employees whose job titles are <code>Sales Rep</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep';
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre>
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| lastname  | firstname | jobtitle  |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Jennings  | Leslie    | Sales Rep |
| Thompson  | Leslie    | Sales Rep |
| Firrelli  | Julie     | Sales Rep |
| Patterson | Steve     | Sales Rep |
| Tseng     | Foon Yue  | Sales Rep |
| Vanauf    | George    | Sales Rep |
| Bondur    | Loui      | Sales Rep |
| Hernandez | Gerard    | Sales Rep |
| Castillo  | Pamela    | Sales Rep |
| Bott      | Larry     | Sales Rep |
| Jones     | Barry     | Sales Rep |
| Fixter    | Andy      | Sales Rep |
| Marsh     | Peter     | Sales Rep |
| King      | Tom       | Sales Rep |
| Nishi     | Mami      | Sales Rep |
| Kato      | Yoshimi   | Sales Rep |
| Gerard    | Martin    | Sales Rep |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
17 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>SELECT</code> statement examines all rows of the employees table and selects only rows whose values are in the jobTitle column are <code>Sales Rep</code>.</p>


<h3>Example 2 : And Operator</h3>
<p>The following example uses the <code>WHERE</code> clause to find employees whose job titles are <code>Sales Rep</code> and office codes are <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle,
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' AND officeCode = 1;
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre>
+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| lastname | firstname | jobtitle  | officeCode |
+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| Jennings | Leslie    | Sales Rep | 1          |
| Thompson | Leslie    | Sales Rep | 1          |
+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>In this example, the expression in the <code>WHERE</code> clause uses the <code>AND</code> operator to combine two conditions:</p>
<pre>
jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' AND officeCode = 1;
</pre>
<p>The <code>AND</code> operator evaluates to <code>TRUE</code> only if both expressions are evaluated to <code>TRUE</code>. Therefore, the query returns rows whose values in the <code>jobTitle</code> column is <code>Sales Rep</code> and <code>officeCode</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>


<h3>Example 3 : OR Operator</h3>
<p>This query finds employees whose job title is <code>Sales Rep</code> or employees who locate the office with office code <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastName, 
    firstName, 
    jobTitle, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' OR officeCode = 1
ORDER BY 
    officeCode, jobTitle;
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre>
+-----------+-----------+--------------------+------------+
| lastName  | firstName | jobTitle           | officeCode |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------+------------+
| Murphy    | Diane     | President          | 1          |
| Bow       | Anthony   | Sales Manager (NA) | 1          |
| Jennings  | Leslie    | Sales Rep          | 1          |
| Thompson  | Leslie    | Sales Rep          | 1          |
| Firrelli  | Jeff      | VP Marketing       | 1          |
| Patterson | Mary      | VP Sales           | 1          |
| Firrelli  | Julie     | Sales Rep          | 2          |
| Patterson | Steve     | Sales Rep          | 2          |
| Tseng     | Foon Yue  | Sales Rep          | 3          |
| Vanauf    | George    | Sales Rep          | 3          |
| Bondur    | Loui      | Sales Rep          | 4          |
| Hernandez | Gerard    | Sales Rep          | 4          |
| Castillo  | Pamela    | Sales Rep          | 4          |
| Gerard    | Martin    | Sales Rep          | 4          |
| Nishi     | Mami      | Sales Rep          | 5          |
| Kato      | Yoshimi   | Sales Rep          | 5          |
| Fixter    | Andy      | Sales Rep          | 6          |
| Marsh     | Peter     | Sales Rep          | 6          |
| King      | Tom       | Sales Rep          | 6          |
| Bott      | Larry     | Sales Rep          | 7          |
| Jones     | Barry     | Sales Rep          | 7          |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------+------------+
21 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>The <code>OR</code> operator evaluates to <code>TRUE</code> only if one of the expressions evaluates to <code>TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre>
jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' OR officeCode = 1
</pre>
<p>Therefore, the query returns any employee who has the job title <code>Sales Rep</code> or office code <code>1</code>.</p>


<h3>Example 4 : Other Operators</h3>
<p>The following query finds employees who are located in offices whose office code is from <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    firstName, 
    lastName, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    officeCode BETWEEN 1 AND 3
ORDER BY officeCode;
</pre>
<p>The following query finds the employees whose last names end with the string 'son':</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    firstName, 
    lastName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    lastName LIKE '%son'
ORDER BY firstName;
</pre>
<p>The following example uses the <code>WHERE</code> clause with the <code>IN</code> operator to find employees who are located in the offices with the codes <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    firstName, 
    lastName, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    officeCode IN (1 , 2, 3)
ORDER BY 
    officeCode;
</pre>
<p>The following statement uses the <code>WHERE</code> clause with the <code>IS NULL</code> operator to get the rows with the values in the <code>reportsTo</code> column are <code>NULL</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastName, 
    firstName, 
    reportsTo
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    reportsTo IS NULL;
</pre>

<h3>Example 5 : Comparison Operators</h3>
<p>The following table shows the comparison operators that you can use to form the expression in the <code>WHERE</code> clause.</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>=</code> : Equal to. You can use it with almost any data type.</li>
    <li><code><></code>	or <code>!=</code>: Not equal to.</li>
    <li><code><</code>: Less than. You typically use it with numeric and date/time data types.</li>
    <li><code>></code>:	Greater than.</li>
    <li><code><=</code>: Less than or equal to.</li>
    <li><code>>=</code>: Greater than or equal to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example: The following query uses the not equal to (<code><></code>) operator to find all employees who are not the <code>Sales Rep</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle <> 'Sales Rep';
</pre>
<p>The following query finds employees whose office code is greater than <code>5</code>:</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE 
    officecode > 5;
</pre>
<p>The following query returns employees with office code less than or equal to <code>4</code>(<code><=4</code>):</p>
<pre>
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE 
    officecode <= 4;
</pre>
