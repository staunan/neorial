<h1>What is MJML?</h1>
<p>MJML is a markup language designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward and its rich standard components library speeds up your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJMLâ€™s open-source engine generates high quality responsive HTML compliant with best practices.</p>


<h1>mjml</h1>
<p>A MJML document starts with a <code>&lt;mjml></code> tag, it can contain only <code>mj-head</code> and <code>mj-body</code> tags. Both have the same purpose of head and body in a HTML document.</p>



<h1>mj-head</h1>
<p><code>mj-head</code> contains everything related to the document such as style and meta elements. It supports custom head elements and can be registered through registerMJHeadElement(&lt;string> name, &lt;function> handler) api from mjml-core, it acts as a pre-render hook. Note that this tag is optional.</p>



<h1>mj-body</h1>
<p><code>mj-body</code> contains everything related to the content of your email. It supports custom elements too and can be registered either through registerMJElement(&lt;MJMLElement> class) api from mjml-core or via a <code>.mjmlconfig</code> file. Unknown element from mjml-core are simply ignored. Note that <code>mj-body</code> should have only one root element due to how React works.</p>


<h1>File Extension</h1>
<p>Note that the file must be a file with a `.mjml` extension.</p>



<h1>mj-include</h1>
<p>The mjml-core package allows you to include external mjml files to build your email template.</p>
<p>You can wrap your external mjml files inside the default mjml > mj-body tags to make it easier to preview outside the main template.</p>
<p>The MJML engine will then replace your included files before starting the rendering process</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- header.mjml -->
&lt;mj-section>
  &lt;mj-column>
    &lt;mj-text>This is a header&lt;/mj-text>
  &lt;/mj-column>
&lt;/mj-section>

&lt;!-- main.mjml -->
&lt;mjml>
  &lt;mj-body>
    &lt;mj-include path="./header" /> &lt;!-- or 'header.mjml' -->
  &lt;/mj-body>
&lt;/mjml>
