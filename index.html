	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="NPM/TOC.html">NPM</a></h3>
	<p>NPM is Node Package Manager. This tutorial contains fundamental concept of NPM like how to create a package, publishing it and using it in your project. Installing and uninstalling packages. Updating and publishing packages, versioning. etc. This tutorial is more than enough to get started with NPM.</p>


	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="Vuex/TOC.html">Vuex</a></h3>
	<p>Vuex is a very small framework that works with <code>Vue.js</code>. It is specially for managing State. Vue already uses state in it's component which are declared as <code>data</code> option. But these are local state. What if a component wants to use some state of another component, technically which are called shared state. If a component change the shared state, the other components that uses the same state should be updated dynamically and automatically. We can do this without using Vuex, but it will be a nightmare if the application grows in size and will be really difficult for managing stuff. Vuex simplify the above problem and keep the Global shared data under a mechanism that ensures the modularity and efficiency. Vuex also comes with lots of feature that all of them cannot be found in other single framework. Thanks to Vuex to simplify the State Management and make the life so much easier.</p>

	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="JavaScript/TOC.html">JavaScript Tutorial</a></h3>
	<p style="margin-top: 0;">Javascript is the topmost programming language in the world. It is number one in the list of top programming languages for 3 years in a row. And in 2019, it is still on the top. Billions of website depends on that language to perform task on the browser. Every brower comes with a Javascript engine. What's more? The backend technology, Node.js is becoming famous and compared with one of the great language PHP who once dominated the Backend part. Now Node.js is taking much percentage of it. Not just Node.js, but also Javascript has started to crawl into mobile developement and becoming favourite to most of the developer. Mobile development with Javascript comes with great flexibility and tons of advantages. Like, an app built with Javascript can be run on different platform with minor changes. Javascript is everywhere and it is becoming more matured and sophisticated. And I am the Monster in Javascript world.</p>


	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="CSS/TOC.html">CSS Tutorial</a></h3>
	<p style="margin-top: 0;">CSS is used to style HTML page. This is one of the Big language. I mean there are lots of things to learn. But one of the easiest language. CSS is must for all front end designing. Based on CSS there are many CSS Preprocessor available like SCSS, SASS, Stylus, PostCSS etc. But CSS considered as such a basic language, it doesn't count for developers. If a developer says that he knows CSS very well, it doesn't change anything at all. It won't make a difference. Because this language is easy to learn and the only language for styling web pages. I have learnt this language at a very deep level and I have a strong understanding of each concept. Though there are still few thing remains, I will cover them up later. But still I'm really good at CSS.</p>


	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="FPDF/TOC.html">FPDF Tutorial</a></h3>
	<p style="margin-top: 0;">FPDF stands for Free PDF. It is a PHP library to create pdf programmitically. It is really very good and neat library but very basic one. For a PDF that is limited to text, image, link, tables, simple drawing etc, It is the best library. It is easy to use and small library. This library doesn't have much learning curve, but I spent almost three days to learning it. And I can create PDF easily and can use almost all the feature it has to offer. Although this library is kind of old and doesn't have the latest PHP7 feature. But it can be used on PHP7. There are other library available in the market that promise to convert HTML to PDF, but none of them are accurate and has many bugs. Later, according to the requirement I will learn another library to create PDF.</p>


	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="MJML/TOC.html">MJML Tutorial</a></h3>
	<p style="margin-top: 0;">Creating Email and also make it responsive accross the device is always a painful task. It's not regular HTML and CSS that you write everyday to create a website. Though most of the Email clients are improving their engine to bring the latest HTML and CSS feature into it. But there are still many Client that doesn't support latest HTML and CSS. And to my surprise Gmail doesn't support latest HTML and CSS. So keeping in mind all the major Email client, writting Email is seriously a painful task. But MJML simplifies most of the thing. Creating Email with MJML is easy but still is not a suitable for Gmail client. MJML generates Media Query CSS and puts it within the Style tag, but Gmail removes any style tag before rendering it. So using MJML for Gmail is not suitable. After learning it for two days what I have observed, it was wasting of time. MJML is actually sets of Components and it has few rules of how to use these components. MJML generates pure HTML based on the MJML code. In my opinion, we should follow the guidelines of how to create Email using pure CSS and HTML rather than using MJML. Besides, with MJML you cannot have a complex layout. Only very basic layouts can be done greatly and still it is not Gmail supported. MJML uses <code>table</code> element to build the layout. And they nest the table within the table as deepest as they could. So what if you could learn how they are doing it in the actual HTML and CSS and achieving the responsiveness and layout and all. If you can learn it you can get rid of external library and also you can have more deep learning skill about Email. It will also give you actual experience of Email layout in different Client.</p>
