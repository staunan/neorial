<h1>The start of the journey</h1>
<p class="Date">2025-01-21</p>
<p>Today I started my work. I want to be a millionaire by the time I'm 40. I want to be able to provide for my family and give them the best life possible. I want to be able to travel the world and experience new things. I want to be able to help others and make a difference in the world. I want to be able to retire early and enjoy my life.</p>

<p>And if there is anything that can fullfil my dreams, it is programming. I want to be able to create my own software and applications that can help others and make a difference in the world. I want to be able to create my own websites and applications that can help others and make a difference in the world.</p>

<p>There are thousand ideas in my mind. It is really hard to choose one. So I just decided to start with an app without debating with myself about why this app.  It may be a failure, but I will learn from it and move on to the next idea.</p>

<p>I will create an app which will track my daily habits and goals. It is an simple app, basic idea i guess, and hopefully there won't be any problems with it. Instead of making website, I will make an app. I will use flutter for this. I will learn flutter and I will create an app. And for backend server i will use golang.</p>

<p>But i need to read the documentation of flutter and golang first. I will read the documentation and then i will start to code.</p>

<p>So my next move is to finish the core part of golang. Complete all the theory, the language basics, all the concepts and practice a little bit.</p>
