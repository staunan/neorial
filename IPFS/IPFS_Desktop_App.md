# IPFS Desktop App
IPFS Desktop bundles an IPFS node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer into a single, easy-to-use application. 
If you already have an IPFS node on your computer, IPFS Desktop will act as a control panel and file browser for that node. If you don't have a node, it'll install one for you. And either way, IPFS Desktop will automatically check for updates.
IPFS Desktop is built using the Electron framework (opens new window), so the application should work wherever Electron works.
Download the app from Github or IPFS home page, and then install it on your system.
