<h1>Packages and Modules</h1>
<p>The npm registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.</p>




<h1>Packages</h1>
<p>A package is a file or directory that is described by a <code>package.json</code> file. A package must contain a <code>package.json</code> file in order to be published to the npm registry. For more information on creating a <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p>Packages can be unscoped or scoped to a user or Org, and scoped packages can be private or public.</p>
<h3>Package Format</h3>
<p>A package is any of the following:</p>
<ul type="a">
	<li>A folder containing a program described by a package.json file.</li>
	<li>A gzipped tarball containing (a).</li>
	<li>A URL that resolves to (b).</li>
	<li>A <code>&lt;name>@&lt;version></code> that is published on the registry with (c).</li>
	<li>A <code>&lt;name>@&lt;tag></code> that points to (d).</li>
	<li>A <code>&lt;name></code> that has a latest tag satisfying (e).</li>
	<li>A <code>git</code> url that, when cloned, results in (a).</li>
</ul>
<h3>npm package git URL formats</h3>
<p>Git URLs used for npm packages can be formatted in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish</li>
	<li>git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish</li>
	<li>git+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish</li>
	<li>git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>commit-ish</code> can be any tag, sha, or branch that can be supplied as an argument to git checkout. The default <code>commit-ish</code> is <code>master</code></p>








<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>A module is any file or directory in the <code>node_modules</code> directory that can be loaded by the Node.js <code>require()</code> function.</p>
<p>To be loaded by the Node.js <code>require()</code> function, a module must be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A folder with a <code>package.json</code> file containing a "main" field.</li>
	<li>A folder with an <code>index.js</code> file in it.</li>
	<li>A JavaScript file.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Since modules are not required to have a <code>package.json</code> file, not all modules are packages. Only modules that have a <code>package.json</code> file are also packages. So if a folder contains <code>package.json</code> can be called either a module or a package. But if the folder doesn't contain any <code>package.json</code> file, it cannot be called a package. It is a module.</p>









<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>There are billions of packages in the NPM registry. So it is very common that your package name can match with others. To resolve this conflict, you can use scope that allows you to create package with the same name.</p>
<p>The scope name is everything between the @ and the slash:</p>
<pre>
// npm scope
@npm/package-name
// npmcorp
@npmcorp/package-name
</pre>
<h3>Package Visibility</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Unscoped packages are always public.</li>
	<li>Private packages are always scoped.</li>
	<li>Scoped packages are private by default; you must pass a command-line flag when publishing to make them public.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 500;">Your username is always the scope name.</p>






<h1>Public Packages</h1>
<p>As an npm user or Org member, you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Unscoped</code> public packages exist in the global public registry namespace and can be referenced in a <code>package.json</code> file with the package name alone: <code style="white-space: nowrap;">package-name</code>.</li>
	<li>
		<code>Scoped</code> public packages belong to a user or Org and must be preceded by the user or Org name when included as a dependency in a <code>package.json</code> file:
		<ul>
			<li>@username/package-name</li>
			<li>@org-name/package-name</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>










<h1>Private Packages</h1>
<p>With npm private packages, you can use the npm registry to host code that is only visible to you and chosen collaborators, allowing you to manage and use private code alongside public code in your projects. To create or use private packages you must be a paid user.</p>
<p>Private packages always have a scope, and scoped packages are private by default.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>User-scoped private packages</code> can only be accessed by you and collaborators to whom you have granted read or read/write access.</li>
	<li><code>Org-scoped private packages</code> can only be accessed by teams that have been granted read or read/write access.</li>
</ul>







<h1>Package Visibility and Scope</h1>
<p>Visibility of npm packages depends on the scope (namespace) in which the package is contained, and the access level (private or public) set for the package.</p>
