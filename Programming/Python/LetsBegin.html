<h1>Let's Begin The Journy With Python</h1>
<p>Today <code>Sat Mar 16 2019 16:10:21 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)</code>. I'm in my office. Today is Saturday, I will leave at 6. I took Ganja. Almost whole day I'm in the effect of Ganja. I seriously hate it. Anyway, I was thinking that from tomorrow I will begin a new day and with this day I will start my Programming Journey (as usual). From tomorrow, my mind will always think about Code, everytime it will just code. In future I will be coding for my whole life. I want to get the whole taste of it. So let's start my journey so that in near future, I can call myself a true coder. I will just keep learning, I will be a Ninja Coder and mastermind in programming architecture and structure. Ain't no ones gonna mess with Neo. So, start your journey, and never waste a single hour of your life.</p>
<p>But what programming language to start? I must not cage myself within the Web Development area. I want to get into system programming and data science. I want to do something big. Like Artificial Intelligence or Robotics. This is my dream. I will be like a Data Scientist. Do whatever it takes. Chase your dream. From Now on.</p>
<p>Speaking of Languages, I need to pick up a language where I can learn data science related stuff. After researching on the Internet I came to know that Python and R is used for data science. And Python is the second topmost language after Javascript in the whole world. No one can beat python, it tooks the Number 2 position in the whole universe. So let's get my hand dirty mastering the architecture of Python. Not just the language, but let's go deeper into that Programming language. And there's another language called Javascript. Is the world's most number 1 programming language. Without it the whole web is useless. Billions of website relies on Javascript. Not just that, Javascript is the language for Node.js server. Node.js is a server side environment for Javascript. So one language, you can dominate both part. Just like python. You can also use python in various domain, from the backend server to system programming artichture, from data science to artificial intelligence. These two languages can make me the one I ever wanted to be. So without furture ado, let's loose my head in these two programming languages. Cause I am a God Damn hell lot of a Coder.</p>






<h1>Downloading and installing</h1>
<p>Download Python software for Windows and install It. It will install two software, one is 64-bit Command promt, and another is IDLE which you can use to test python script. Once the installation is successful, open IDLE, to interact with the programming language.</p>




<h1>Interactive Mode</h1>
<h3>Interactive Mode</h3>
<p>In Interactive Mode, you can type any statement, and when you hit "Enter" key, the shell will print the output right away right at the bottom of your statement. This mode is called Interactive Mode. To try python in Interactive Mode, you can open IDLE which is installed when you installed Python.</p>
<h3>Primary Prompt</h3>
<p>In this interactive mode, the very first output you will see :</p>
<pre>
Python 3.6.3 (v3.6.3:2c5fed8, Oct  3 2017, 18:11:49) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> 
</pre>
<p>In the above, the symbol <code>>>></code> is called Primary Prompt. When you type, the typing will start after that prompt. That prompt takes whatever you type and executes it when you hit "Enter".</p>

<h3>Secondary Prompt</h3>
<p>The secondary prompt is <code>...</code> (three dots). In this prompt, you can provide multiline statements. It is a line continuation prompt, allows you to type more than one line. And execute everything at onec.</p>





<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Let's print a Hello World message.</p>
<pre>
>>> print ("Hello World");

// Output :
Hello World
</pre>
<p>Here, we have used <code>print</code> statement to print something in the console. We will learn about this later.</p>




<h1>Number</h1>
<p>Let's play around with numbers in that interactive mode.</p>
<h3>Basic Arithmetic Operators</h3>
<p>Basic four arithmetic operators are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>*</code>. They perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division respectively. Here is a demo:</p>
<pre>
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
</pre>
<p>The values, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code> etc have <code>int</code> type. And <code>1.6</code>, <code>5.0</code> have <code>float</code> type.</p>
<p>Division always returns float value.</p>
<h3>Floor Division</h3>
<p>To do a floor division, you can use <code>basic</code> arithmetic operators and they will be bound to the last numeric digit. In case, the digit is negative, the fractional part will be type of number of frequency that the device generates.</p>
<p>In this architecture, the floor division is necesarry to print all the numbers from 0 and upwards.</p>
