		<h1>String</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects. Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.</p>
		<p>The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.</p>
		<h2>Creating String</h2>
		<pre>
			String greeting = "Hello world!";
		</pre>
		<p>Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a String object with its value in this case, "Hello world!'.</p>
		<p>
			As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the new keyword and a constructor. The String class has 11 constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources, such as an array of characters.
		</p>
		<pre>
			public class StringDemo {

				public static void main(String args[]) {
					char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
					String helloString = new String(helloArray);  
					System.out.println( helloString );
			   }
			}
		</pre>
		<p>Output -</p>
		<pre>
			hello.
		</pre>
		<div class="box">
			Note − The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer &amp; String Builder Classes.
		</div>
		<h2>Length</h2>
		<p>The <code>length()</code> methods integer that specifies the number of character in a string.</p>
		<pre>
			String palindrome = "Hello World";
			int len = palindrome.length();
		</pre>
		<h2>Concatenating Strings</h2>
		<p>The method <code>concat()</code> is used to concatenate string.</p>
		<pre>
			string1.concat(string2);
		</pre>
		<p>This returns a new string that is string1 with string2 added to it at the end. You can also use the concat() method with string literals, as in −</p>
		<pre>
			"My name is ".concat("Zara");
		</pre>
		<p>Strings are more commonly concatenated with the + operator, as in −</p>
		<pre>"Hello," + " world" + "!</pre>
		<p>Example -</p>
		<pre>
			public class StringDemo {

				public static void main(String args[]) {
					String string1 = "saw I was ";
					System.out.println("Dot " + string1 + "Tod");
				}
			}
		</pre>
		<p>Output - </p>
		<pre>
			Dot saw I was Tod
		</pre>
