<h1>Variable</h1>
<p>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors and other data.</p>
<p>To create a variable in JavaScript, we need to use the <code>let</code> keyword.</p>
<p>The statement below creates (in other words: declares or defines) a variable with the name “message”:</p>
<pre>
let message;
</pre>
<p>Now we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator <code>=</code>:</p>
<pre>
let message;

message = 'Hello'; // store the string
</pre>
<p>The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:</p>
<pre>
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

alert(message); // shows the variable contents
</pre>
<p>To be concise we can merge the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:</p>
<pre>
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
</pre>
<p>We can also declare multiple variables in one line:</p>
<pre>
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
</pre>





<h1>var instead of let</h1>
<p>In older scripts you may also find another keyword: var instead of let:</p>
<pre>
var message = 'Hello';
</pre>
<p>The <code>var</code> keyword is almost the same as <code>let</code>. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, “old-school” fashion. Let's discuss the difference between <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>.</p>
<h3>“var” has no block scope</h3>
<p><code>var</code> variables are either function-wide or global, they are visible through blocks. It means if you declare a variable inside a block using the keyword <code>var</code>, the variable is accessible from outside of the block.</p>
<pre>
if (true) {
  var test = true; // use "var" instead of "let"
}

alert(test); // true, the variable lives after if
</pre>
<p>The same thing happens for the loop too -</p>
<pre>
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // ...
}

alert(i); // 10, "i" is visible after loop, it's a global variable
</pre>
<p>Another difference is that if a code block is inside a function, then <code>var</code> becomes a function-level variable:</p>
<pre>
function sayHi() {
  if (true) {
    var phrase = "Hello";
  }

  alert(phrase); // works
}

sayHi();
alert(phrase); // Error: phrase is not defined
</pre>
<p>...But if you declare a variable inside a function block (outside any other block within the function), it is also available outside of the function -</p>
<pre>
function sayHi(name1){
	var name = name1;
}
sayHi("Santanu Bera");
name = "Hi";
console.log(name); // Hi
</pre>
<p>This mechanisam can be explained in a simple way. When Javascript starts executing file, first it looks for all the function definition and variables defined using <code>var</code>. Then it starts executing the file. That's why no matter where you define your variable doesn't matter at all. All the <code>var</code> declaration happens before execution of the file, and that's why <code>var</code> variables are available before even the execution starts. Using this concept you can even define a variable even after using it -</p>
<pre>
function sayHi() {
  phrase = "Hello";

  alert(phrase);

  var phrase;
}
</pre>
<p>Even the following is not an error -</p>
<pre>
function sayHi() {
  phrase = "Hello"; // (*)

  if (false) {
    var phrase;
  }

  alert(phrase);
}
</pre>
<p>People also call such behavior “hoisting” (raising), because all var are “hoisted” (raised) to the top of the function.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not.</p>
<pre>
function sayHi() {
  alert(phrase);

  var phrase = "Hello";
}

sayHi();
</pre>
<p>The line <code>var phrase = "Hello"</code> has two actions in it:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Variable declaration <code>var</code></li>
	<li>Variable assignment <code>=</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The declaration is processed at the start of function execution (“hoisted”), but the assignment always works at the place where it appears. So the code works essentially like this:</p>
<pre>
function sayHi() {
  var phrase; // declaration works at the start...

  alert(phrase); // undefined

  phrase = "Hello"; // ...assignment - when the execution reaches it.
}

sayHi();
</pre>
<p>Because all <code>var</code> declarations are processed at the function start, we can reference them at any place. But variables are <code>undefined</code> until the assignments. In both examples above <code>alert</code> runs without an error, because the variable phrase exists. But its value is not yet assigned, so it shows <code>undefined</code>.</p>











<h1>Variable Naming</h1>
<p>There are two limitations for a variable name in JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name must contain only letters, digits, symbols $ and _.</li>
	<li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are valid -</p>
<pre>
let userName;
let test123;
</pre>
<p>When the name contains multiple words, <code>camelCase</code> is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word starts with a capital letter: <code>myVeryLongName</code>.</p>
<p>What’s interesting – the dollar sign '$' and the underscore '_' can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.</p>
<p>The following variable names are valid -</p>
<pre>
let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"
let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"

alert($ + _); // 3
</pre>
<p>Examples of incorrect variable names:</p>
<pre>
let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // a hyphen '-' is not allowed in the name
</pre>






<h1>Case Sensitive</h1>
<p>Variables named apple and AppLE – are two different variables.</p>


<h1>Reserved Names</h1>
<p>There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names, because they are used by the language itself. For example, words <code>let</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>function</code> are reserved.</p>
<pre>
let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
</pre>






<h1>An Assignment without <code>use strict</code></h1>
<p>Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value, without <code>let</code>. This still works now if we don’t put <code>use strict</code>. The behavior is kept for compatibility with old scripts.</p>
<pre>
// note: no "use strict" in this example

num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if didn't exist

alert(num); // 5
</pre>
<p>That’s a bad practice, it gives an error in the strict mode:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";

num = 5; // error: num is not defined
</pre>





<h1>Constant</h1>
<p>To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, one can use <code>const</code> instead of <code>let</code>:</p>
<pre>
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
</pre>
<p>Variables declared using <code>const</code> are called “constants”. They cannot be changed. An attempt to do it would cause an error:</p>
<pre>
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
</pre>


<h3>Uppercase Constant</h3>
<p>There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution. Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.</p>
<pre>
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00
</pre>
