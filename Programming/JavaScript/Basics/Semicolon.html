<h1>Semicolons</h1>
<p>A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. The following would work -</p>
<pre>
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
</pre>
<p>Here JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. That’s also called an <code>automatic semicolon insertion</code>.</p>
<p><b>In most cases a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!</b></p>
<pre>
alert(3 +
1
+ 2);
</pre>
<p>The code outputs 6, because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, no semicolon required. And in this case that works as intended.</p>
<p><b>But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.</b></p>
<p>It’s recommended to put semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let’s note once again – it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.</p>
